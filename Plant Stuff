biome temp list: https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/blob/master/Win/biomes.cpp

For temperature, plants will have a debuff in biomes 0.3 above or below the listed range range
will have massive denuff in biomes outside of that secondary range (this applies to all of the crows below as well unless otherwise noted)

idk figure something out for environment score to do with hydration later




Carrots:
1-2-3 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 40-60 percent, tolerates 15-39 and 61-85 percent with debuff
will grow best in temperate biomes (0.6-0.9)
no nutrient fixing

Potatoes:
2-1-4 | N-P-K
60-80 percent hydration, tolerates 30-59 and 81-90 percent with debuff
will grow best in temperate biomes (0.6-0.9)
no nutrient fixing

Wheat:
Wants 100% nitrogen
Hydration -- 40-60 percent, tolerates 15-39 and 61-85 percent with debuff
will grow best in cold-temperate biomes (0.3-0.7)
Fixes adds Phosphorus and Potassium to the soil at an equal rate

Beetroot:
1-1-1 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 20-40 percent, tolerates 10-19 and 41-60 percent with debuff
will grow best in cold biomes (0.3-0.5)
no nutrient fixing

Pumpkins:
2-1-4 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 70-85 percent, tolerates 40-69 and 86-95 percent with debuff
will grow best in warm-temperate biomes (0.7-1.0)
no nutrient fixing

Melons:
2-1-4 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 50-100 percent, tolerates 30-49 percent with debuff
will grow best in warm biomes (0.95-1.2)
no nutrient fixing

***FARMERS DELIGHT***

Tomatoes:
1-2-4 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 50-70 percent, tolerates 20-49 and 71-90 percent with debuff
will grow best in warmer biomes (0.7-1.0)
no nutrient fixing

Cabbage:
2-1-2 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 10-65 percent, tolerates 5-9 and 66-80 percent with debuff
will grow best in temperate biomes (0.6-0.9)
no nutrient fixing

Onions:
1-1-1 | N-P-K
Hydration -- 30-50 percent, tolerates 15-29 and 51-70 percent with debuff
will grow best in temperate-warm biomes (0.7-1.0)
